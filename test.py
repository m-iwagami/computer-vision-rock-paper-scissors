class Game:
    '''
    A game of Rock, Paper, Scissors in which the user plays against the computer.
    The user inputs their chosen gesture using the camera.
    The computer chooses its move randomly from a pre-determined list.
    Attributes:
    ----------
    model: load_model('keras_model.h5')
        Loads computer vision model used in the application.
    cap: cv2.VideoCapture(0)
        Video capture constructor for opencv.
    data: array of tuples
        The model's probabilities for each element of gesture_list.
    user: str
        Attributes the name "user" to the user.
    computer: str 
        Attributes the name "computer" to the computer.
    round_number: int
        Used to calculate the round number. Starts at 1 by default.
    computer_lives: int
        Number of lives left for the computer. Fixed at 3 by default.
    user_lives: int
        Number of lives left for the user. Fixed at 3 by default.
    spacer: str
        String that prints out a separator to make the output clearer.
    Methods:
    -------
    countdown_counter())
        Slows down the machine; asks the user to prepare to show their hand.
    counter_spacer()
        Slows down the program to make the application accessible for the user.
    get_computer_choice()
        Gets the computer's input randomly from gesture_list.
    get_camera()
        Turns on the camera to be used to play.
    get_prediction()
        Understands the user's input using probability.
    classify_output()
        Uses the list of probabilities from get_prediction() to determine the image inputted in the camera.
    get_winner()
        Returns the name of the winner.
    lives_counter()
        Keep track of the number of remaining lives for each user.
